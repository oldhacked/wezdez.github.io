<h3>When it comes to methods, what is the difference between a “parameter” and an “argument”? Is there one? When would you use one versus the other?</h3>

<p>When a method is called the arguments are stated within the parethesis following the method name. The parameter is the variable that is declared within a method declaration. An argument is the information beeing fed into the method through the parameter. In a way, its like the argument defines the variable(parameter) that is declared within the method declaration.
