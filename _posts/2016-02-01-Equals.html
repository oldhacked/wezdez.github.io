<h3>When would you use ‘=’ vs ‘==’ vs ‘.equals’? Explain what each of these does and in which cases you should use them.</h3>
<p>'=' : The single equals sign is used to define/initialize/assign a value to a variable. Example: int y = 5. </p>
<p>'==': The double equals sign is used as an operator to make a value comparison. Example: if( y == 5){ System.out.println("y is equal to 5");}</p>
<p>'.equals': To make a value comparisons between strings, string uses a built-in method called '.equals'. Example: if (stringInputVar.equals(comparateStringVar)) { /*code*/ }</p>
