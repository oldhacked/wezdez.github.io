<h3>What is ‘void’ in a method declaration? How does this differ from declaring a method with a return type?</h3>

<p>Void is the "lack of" return type. You state void if you are not outputing a value from the method. For example, if you are using a method to print something to the screen, then no calculations were involved- thus no outputs. If you are running operations inside the method and you want to use the output, you need to declare that method with its data type that you wish to store your output into.
